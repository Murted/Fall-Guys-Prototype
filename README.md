Fall Guys Prototype
You have to jump on square platforms to get to the finish line, but there are 4 traps that can catch you off guard:
1 - Mine Trap(pink). When stepping on a platform, it lights up yellow and explodes after a second, dealing 25 damage to everyone on the platform.
2 - Fan Trap(dark green). Stepping on the platform will move you in different directions, the wind direction changes every 2 seconds.
3 - Pusher Platform (purple). On the platform vertically moves another platform, which pushes players to the abyss.
4 - Icebox Platform (blue). When stepping on the platform, it lights up in light blue colour and disappears after 2 seconds
